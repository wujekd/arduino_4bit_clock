# arduino_4bit_clock
 A simple binary counter that I made for work as a student learning assistant where students had to build a 4bit traffic light system with logic gates. The idea is to be able to run the light sequence as well as to help debug the breadboard design being able to quickly check binary values instead of reconnecting the cables. The device runs a 4 bit counter that features tempo adjustment and sequence direction change when its running and manually skipping through individual values when the clock is stopped (speed turned down to 0). It has an lcd display implemented.
